## 1. Overview

The `TypeCard` component is a presentational component responsible for displaying a Pokémon type within a visually styled card.  The card's color scheme is dynamically determined based on the provided Pokémon type.

## 2. Component Props

The `TypeCard` component accepts a single prop:

| Prop Name | Data Type | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | String | The name of the Pokémon type (e.g., "Fire", "Water", "Grass"). | Yes |


## 3. Styling and Color Determination

The component utilizes the `pokemonTypeColors` object imported from the `../utils` module. This object maps Pokémon type names to color information.  The `style` attribute dynamically assigns the `color` and `background` properties of the div element based on the provided `type` prop and the data in `pokemonTypeColors`.

For example, if `type` is "Fire", the component will look up `pokemonTypeColors["Fire"]`, expecting an object with `color` and `background` properties defining the card's text and background colors respectively.  The optional chaining operator (`?.`) is used to gracefully handle cases where a type is not found in `pokemonTypeColors`, preventing errors. If a type is missing from `pokemonTypeColors`, the card will not have a background color.

## 4. Function Implementation Details

The `TypeCard` component is a functional component defined using the following structure:

```javascript
export default function TypeCard(props) {
    const { type } = props
    return (
      <div style={{color: pokemonTypeColors[type]['color'], 
      background: pokemonTypeColors?.[type]?.background}}>
        <p>{type}</p>
      </div>
    )
}
```

The component directly renders a `div` element containing a paragraph (`<p>`) displaying the Pokémon type.  The `style` attribute of the `div` is an object literal that sets the `color` and `background` properties.  These properties are determined by accessing the `pokemonTypeColors` object using the provided `type` as the key.

The code leverages the optional chaining operator (`?.`) for robust error handling. If `pokemonTypeColors[type]` or its `background` property is undefined (meaning the type is not found in the lookup table), the background will not be set. This prevents runtime errors and ensures graceful degradation if a type is not properly defined within the `pokemonTypeColors` utility.  The `color` property lookup uses bracket notation to access the `color` property of the inner object to maintain consistency and avoid potential issues with reserved keywords.
