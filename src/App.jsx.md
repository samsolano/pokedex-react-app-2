## 1. Overview

This document details the structure and functionality of the `App.js` file, the main component of the React application.  The application currently displays a Pokemon card (`Pokecard`) and a side navigation bar (`Sidenav`).  Future development will include fetching and displaying Pokemon data from an API.

## 2. File Structure

The `App.js` file imports several React components and a CSS stylesheet:

| Import Statement        | Description                                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `Header`                | Main header component (assumed to contain title, etc.) |
| `Modal`                 | Modal component (currently unused)                    |
| `Sidenav`               | Side navigation bar component                        |
| `TypeCard`              | Pokemon type card component (currently unused)        |
| `Pokecard`              | Displays information for a selected Pokemon         |
| `'./Fanta.css'`        | Stylesheet for the application                       |
| `{useState}` from `react` | React Hook for managing component state               |


## 3. Component Breakdown

### 3.1 `App` Component

The `App` component is the root component of the application. It renders the following:

*   A `Header` component.
*   A `Pokecard` component, which receives the `selectedPokemon` state as a prop.
*   A `Sidenav` component, also receiving the `selectedPokemon` state as a prop.

The `App` component uses the `useState` hook to manage the `selectedPokemon` state. This state variable determines which Pokemon's data is displayed in the `Pokecard` component.  The initial value of `selectedPokemon` is set to 'bulbasaur'. Both `Pokecard` and `Sidenav` components can update this state (likely through user interaction, although specifics are not implemented in this code snippet).


```javascript
function App() {
  const [selectedPokemon, setSelectedPokemon] = useState('bulbasaur');

  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <Pokecard selectedPokemon={selectedPokemon} setSelectedPokemon={setSelectedPokemon} />
      <Sidenav selectedPokemon={selectedPokemon} setSelectedPokemon={setSelectedPokemon} />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```


## 4. Data Flow

The data flow is unidirectional:

1.  The `App` component holds the `selectedPokemon` state.
2.  The `selectedPokemon` state is passed as a prop to both the `Pokecard` and `Sidenav` components.
3.  Changes to `selectedPokemon` (presumably triggered by user interaction within `Sidenav`) are handled through the `setSelectedPokemon` function, updating the state in the `App` component, and causing a re-render of both `Pokecard` and `Sidenav`.

## 5. API Interaction (Future Implementation)

The inline comment `//hit the api and get the data and list it` indicates a planned future implementation to fetch Pokemon data from an external API. This would likely involve using `fetch` or a similar API call within a lifecycle method or effect hook to retrieve data, then updating the component's state with the fetched data to dynamically populate the `Pokecard` component.  The specific API endpoint and data handling logic are not yet defined in this code snippet.
